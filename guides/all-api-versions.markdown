## API Versions

The Metasys REST API was first released with Metasys 10.0 and has seen many
changes and additions since then. Please select the appropriate set of
documentation for your release of Metasys.

- [Version 6 for Metasys 15](../../api/v6-15) This is the second release of
  Metasys which has not changed the version number of the API. There are
  non-breaking changes and some newly deprecated operations which make this
  version different from the 14.1 version.
- [Version 6 for Metasys 14.1](../../api/v6-14-1) This is the first release of
  Metasys which has not changed the version number of the API. There are a few
  non-breaking changes to the API that make this version 6 differ slightly from
  the version released with Metasys 14.
- [Version 6 for Metasys 14](../../api/v6)
- [Version 5 for Metasys 13 and 14](../../api/v5)
- [Version 4 for Metasys 12 and 13](../../api/v4)
