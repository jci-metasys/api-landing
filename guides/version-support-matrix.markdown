The list of changes to the API for each version are listed below.

### v6 - 2024-08-12

  - Get trended object (`/timeSeries/{objectId}`)
  - Get trended attribute (`/timeSeries/{objectId}/trendedAttributes/{attributeId}`)

#### Deprecated Operations

  - Get alarms - (`GET /alarms`)
- Audits
  - Get audits - (`GET /audits`)

### v5 - 2023-09-30

#### Added Operations

- Objects
  - Lookup object identifier: `GET /objects/identifiers?fqr=`. This replaces
    `GET /objectIdentifiers?fqr=` which is now deprecated.
- Time Series
  - List all time series (repository): `GET /timeSeries`
  - List trended attributes (repository):
    `GET /timeSeries/{objectId}/trendedAttributes`
  - Get attribute samples:
    `GET timeSeries/{objectId}/trendedAttributes/{attributeId}/samples`
  - Batch operations for time series (repository): `POST /timeSeries/batch`
  - Create samples subscription (buffer):
    `POST /timeSeries/{streamId}/subscriptions`
  - Update samples subscription (buffer):
    `PUT /timeSeries/streams/{streamId}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`

#### Changed Operations

- Objects
  - Get object attributes with samples:
    `GET /objects/{objectId}/trendedAttributes` - **Breaking Changes**
    - Renamed to "List trended attributes (buffer)"
    - Previously this operation would return information from the historical
      repository (database). Now it returns data found in the buffer associated

      (database). Now it returns data found in the buffer associated with the
      specified object. To get information contained in the repository use the
      new operation "Get attribute samples (repository)".

#### Removed Operations

These represent **Breaking Changes**.

  - Get network device attributes with samples. Use "List trended attributes
    (repository)" instead.
