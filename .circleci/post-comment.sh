# Purpose:
# Checks to see if there already exists a comment on the PR that starts with Circle CI Preview.
#   - If it does exist, then it's updated to say "Circle CI Preview Available with link to preview"
#   - If it does not exist, then a new comment is created that says that.

# Notes on the jq
# .[] - Iterate thru the array
# select(.body | contains()) - Select an object if it has a body that contains "Circle CI Preview Available"
# This streams 0 or more objects but not witin an array. The next step will turn it back into an array

# jq -r -s - This invocation of jq uses -s which "slurps" in the stream turning it back into an array
#            The -r says to output raw strings, so if we find a url it'll not have double quotes around it
# first - This says grab the first element of the array (if there is one)
# .url  - This says grab the url from the object (if there is one)
# The output of this if there is no matching element is the raw string null (not an actual null value which is confusing)
