    - title: 'Are there any usage examples?'
      answer: >
        We have created a few examples as a means to show some use cases of how the API might be used. One of the examples
        is a [data extraction utility](!SITE_URL!examples/data-extractor) which aggregates data from within <i class="metasys"></i> and stores it locally for external analysis.

    - title: 'How do I get an **object identifier**?'
      answer: >
        All of the API endpoints accept GUIDs as identifiers for retrieving information for that object. These identifiers may be obtained by querying for a collection
        of the requested objects and in turn, the id property on each item will be what is used for subsequent requests in relation to that object.

  questions:
    - title: 'How do I contribute to this documentation?'
      answer: >
        The landing page is hosted via GitHub pages with the source located in the [<i class="metasys"></i> Server API Landing repo](https://github.com/metasys-server/api-landing){:target="_blank"}
        whereas the actual API documentation is housed in the [<i class="metasys"></i> Server API Docs repo](https://github.com/metasys-server/api-docs){:target="_blank"}. The latter uses Apiary to handle
        the rendering and publishing of the documentation.
